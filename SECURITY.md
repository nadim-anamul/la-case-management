# Security Notice

## ⚠️ Credential Exposure (Fixed)

**Date**: July 29, 2024  
**Status**: RESOLVED

### What Happened
Database credentials were accidentally exposed in the git history during development.

### What Was Exposed
- Database passwords in docker-compose.yml
- Database passwords in .env files

### What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Removed hardcoded passwords from docker-compose files
2. ✅ Updated to use environment variables with secure defaults
3. ✅ Added .env files to .gitignore
4. ✅ Created .env.example with placeholder values
5. ✅ Updated setup scripts to prompt for secure passwords

### Current Security Status
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in git history
- ✅ Environment variables used for all sensitive data
- ✅ .env files excluded from git tracking
- ✅ Setup scripts prompt for secure passwords

### For Users
1. **Update your passwords immediately** if you were using the exposed credentials
2. **Use the new setup process**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set secure passwords
   ./docker-setup.sh
   ```

### For Contributors
- Never commit real credentials to git
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Use .env.example for templates
- Test with placeholder values

### Recommended Actions
1. Change any database passwords that were exposed
2. Rotate any other credentials that might have been compromised
3. Use strong, unique passwords for each environment
4. Consider using a secrets management system for production
